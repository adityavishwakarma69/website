            <h2>Why Use Linux Over Mac And Windows</h2>
            <h3>It's Free</h3>
            <p>Linux is free both as in freedom and as in cost free the code is opensource</p>
            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>Not only linux kernal is free but also the toolset (GNU project) is free as a user there is 100% control and Transparency over your system</p>
            <h3>Choice</h3>
            <p>There are many Linux distributions targeted for doing specific things which might be useful for individuals</p>
            <h2>The Linux Distro I Use</h2>

              <b>Void Linux</b>
            </a>
            <h3>Why Use Void?</h3>
            <p>Void linux id a rolling release linux distribution. You might think why would I prefer it over something like arch linux, let's see</p>
            <h4>It's Not a Fork</h4>
            <p>Like many other distributions void linux is not a fork of any distribution it is written from scratch</p>
            <h4>It's Not GNU bounded</h4>
            <p>Void linux is not GNU bounded it can be used with MuslC to create a GNU free environment (I dont really care but ok)</p>
            <h4>No SystemD</h4>
            <p>Guess what! there is no SystemD your system in you hands</p>
            <h4>Very Stable</h4>
            <p>Super Stable for a rolling release distro</p>
            <h4>Very Fast And Minimal</h4>
            <p>Really fast because there is no SystemD</p>
